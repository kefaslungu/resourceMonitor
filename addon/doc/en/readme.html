<h1>Resource Monitor</h1>
<ul>
<li>Authors: Alex Hall, Joseph Lee, Kefas Lungu, Beqa Gozalishvili, Tuukka Ojala, Ethin Probst and other NVDA contributors</li>
<li>Download <a href="http://addons.nvda-project.org/files/get.php?file=resourceMonitor">stable version</a></li>
<li>NVDA compatibility: 2022.4 and later</li>
</ul>
<p>This add-on gives information about CPU load, memory usage and other resource usage information.</p>
<h1>Shortcuts</h1>
<ul>
<li>NVDA+Shift+E: presents used ram, average processor load, and battery info if available.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+1: presents the average processor load and if multicore CPU's are present the load of each core.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+2/5: presents the used and total space for both physical and virtual ram.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+3: presents the used and total space of the static and removable drives.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+4: presents battery percentage, charging status, remaining time (if not charging), and a warning if the battery is low or critical.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+6: presents  CPU Architecture and Windows version and service pack numbers.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+7: presents the system's uptime.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+8: presents information on the wireless connection, ssid name and strength, or no ssid if there is none available.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can change these shortcut keys via input gestures dialog.</p>
<h2>Usage notes</h2>
<p>This add-on does not replace task manager and other system information programs for Windows. Also note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource information cannot be copied to clipboard if running the add-on in secure screens.</li>
<li>CPU usage is given for logical processors, not physical cores. This is noticeable for processors which uses Hyper-Threading where number of CPU's is twice the number of CPU cores.</li>
<li>If there is heavy disk activity such as copying large files, there might be delays when obtaining disk usage information.</li>
<li>When announcing processor architecture information, "x86" and "AMD64" refer to 32-bit and 64-bit (x64) Intel and AMD processors, respectively.</li>
<li>This add-on requires Windows 10 or later.</li>
</ul>
